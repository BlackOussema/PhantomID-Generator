# Fake Identity Generator

## Description
Generates realistic fake identities and digital fingerprints for safe cybersecurity testing and privacy protection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone or download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/FakeIdentityGenerator.git
cd FakeIdentityGenerator

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment to avoid compatibility issues
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
3. Install required packages (if any)
Note: Skip this step if no requirements.txt or external packages are needed.
4. Run the application
python main.py

##How it works
The app window lets you select how many profiles to generate.

You can choose which fields to include in the profiles.

Press "Generate" to create fake profiles, which appear in the preview.

Export the generated data as JSON or CSV files for further use.

Troubleshooting
If the app does not run directly, try running it inside a virtual environment as shown above.

Ensure Python 3 is installed.

Make sure all project files (main.py, identity_generator.py, fingerprint_generator.py) are in the same folder.
